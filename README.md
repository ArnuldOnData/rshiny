# Why This Repo

This repo contains my 4 days effort at building something small using tools like  R-Shiny, node.js, npm, React, flask, web application development, and a bit of production deployment related to that. All of these tools were pretty much unknown to me so far. That is the reason I picked them up. I wanted to see how long it takes for me to get familiar with unknown tools and building something small with them. 

AIM: I wanted to see if I build something (a scatter plot e.g.) using Shiny and React then if can I create a similar-looking (scatter plot) with Python and Dash.

# Learning #0

Until 4 days ago I didn't even know there was something called **yarn** or **npx** exists. I wasn't even aware of what exactly is **nodejs** or how it is different from **React** or if **Javascript** and **nodejs** are one and the same thing. Forgive me for thinking **Shiny** was some shoe-polish :-|. I have worked mostly on C, C++, and UNIX programming side. Web-app and User-Interface development are fairly new to me. 



# Learning #1

It took 2 days for me to get familiar with how **Shiny** works, how **React** integrates within R using **reactR**, how we can start using **npm** and run a server, how we can use **Flask**  to run web-server and how to create different sliders in **Dash** and **Shiny**.

These 2 days were frustrating because I did find the documentation but could not find much information if how to build similar stuff using 2 different sets of tools. I am sure any computer programmer might get frustrated the same. So I will create a couple of small programs to show you how you can learn this quickly without frustration, how all the pieces fit together. Think of it as a step by step tutorial to start building things with unfamiliar tools in an unfamiliar field. 

I will start with a small "Hello World" program in:
 - Shiny + R
 - Shiny + React
 - Python + Flask 
 - Python + Flask + React
 
 Then we move onto bit more complex programs, step by step. We will take it slow and we will take it easy. 
 Please check each folder's respective README.md file for instructions.
