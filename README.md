# Why This Repo

This repo contains my 4 days effort at building something small using tools like  R-Shiny, node.js, npm, React, flask, and web application development. All of these tools were pretty much unknown to me so far. That is the reason I picked them up. I wanted to see how long it takes for me to get familiar with unknown tools and start building something small with them. 

**AIM:** I wanted to see if I build something using Shiny and React then if I can produce the same output with completely different tools like Python and Dash. If not the same then at least similar in functionality. 


# Learning #0

Until 4 days ago I didn't even know there was something called **yarn** or **npx** exists. I wasn't even aware of what exactly is **nodejs** or how it is different from **React** or if **Javascript** and **nodejs** are one and the same thing. Forgive me for thinking **Shiny** was some shoe-polish :-|. I have worked mostly on C, C++, and UNIX programming side. Web-app and User-Interface development are fairly new to me. 



# Learning #1

It took 2 days for me to get familiar with how **Shiny** works, how **React** integrates within R using **reactR**, how we can start using **npm** and run a server, how we can use **Flask**  to run web-server and how to create different sliders in **Dash** and **Shiny**.

These 2 days were frustrating because I did find the documentation but could not find much information on how to build similar stuff using 2 different sets of tools. I am sure any computer programmer might get frustrated the same. So I decided to create a couple of small programs to show you how you can learn this quickly with lesser amount of frustration, how all the pieces fit together. Think of it as a step by step tutorial to start building things with unfamiliar tools in an unfamiliar field. 

You can start with a *Hello World* folder, see how each of the app/program works producing the same output with different tools. 
Then we move onto bit more complex programs, step by step. We will take it slow, and we will take it easy because fundamentals are important.
You could go on writing code for years doing similar mistakes if you don't have a good grip around fundamentals and it doesn't take much time :-) 
Please check each folder's respective README.md file for instructions. 


# Learning #2

After I spent initial 3 days in learnings #0 and #1  , It took me only a couple of hours to start understanding *rpy2* package. I wrote all the Python code using *rpy2* in about half a day. So total 3.5 days so far.


# Learning #3

It took about another half a day to start understanding parallel computing. I used *Parallel* from R's *base* package and measured the time difference of serial and parallel versions of a program. This completes totoal 4 days of time limit I put on myself.
