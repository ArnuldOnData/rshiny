All the apps in the "Hello World" folder/directory were created to show how to start using the respective language/tool. 
I created them to teach myself basics. I use Linux, hence instructions are applicable only for Linux.



#How to get started 

First, install **nodejs** using your package manager. Then open terminal and do this: 

`npx create-react-app react-hello`  (this will take a while to finish)

`cd react-hello`

It will start the web-server and a new browser window will open which will look like this:

Keep the both the server and broswer window open. Open **react-hello/src/App.js** in your text-editor.
Now either you can manually edit the code or you can remove the entire contents of the file and then copy paste the code 
from  my "App.js" available here:

https://github.com/ArnuldOnData/rshiny/blob/main/Hello%20World/React/App.js

Once you replace the default code with this, web-server will autoomatically refresh the page and you will get this:
